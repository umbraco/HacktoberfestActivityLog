# Hacktoberfest Activity Log
This repository tracks contributions to Umbraco that are not based on a pull request being submitted. 

If you're doing anything significant during Hacktoberfest, please create a pull request to this `README.md` file to track it in one of the categories below, categories are:
 - Low-code / no-code contributions
 - New Umbraco packages

For the Digital Ocean Hacktoberfest participation, you need 4 contributions to be eligible for rewards. For the Umbraco specific Hacktoberfest participation you need 2 contributions to be eligible for rewards. ⭐ Please make sure to follow the [Hacktoberfest rules](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#contributors).

And example of a participation entry is:

- `- 2023-10-04 - Paula Philips - Blog post - [How to get started contributing to Umbraco](https://example.com) - Wrote a blog post describing my first time doing a code contribution to Umbraco`

So the rough format is (feel free to adapt where needed): `Date - Name - Type of low/no-code contribution - Link - Description`.

[Explore last year's list](ARCHIVE2022.md) to get some inspiration.
